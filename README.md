# Sentiment Analysis

Under development will mainly use the MEAN stack and hope to be able to create all code in JavaScript. The tool will take comments about something and classify the overall sentiment towards it using the topic modeling algorithm Latent Dirichlet Allocation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation.

##Install Dependencies
1. npm install
2. bower install
3. npm install -g grunt-cli


##Plan
Plan on using https://www.npmjs.com/package/lda to classify sentiment on a set of comment for a product and determine whether its positive, neutral or negative.
